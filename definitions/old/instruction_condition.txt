Any text indicating the specific circumstances for the instruction associated with the medication – e.g. when and why to follow the instruction.
The text associated with the instruction condition can be in the same sentence or in a different sentence as the relevant instruction or medication, or it can be a section heading.
Consider only the most specific text that signals instruction condition.
An instruction condition can be expressed in an If-clause or statements like “Current Medications”.
If there is text indicating some instructions but no specific medication mentioned, ignore that instruction text.
